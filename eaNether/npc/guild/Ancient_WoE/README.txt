This folder contains Ancient WoE scripts.
If you want to enable those scripts, add it to the scripts_guild.conf in your npc folder.

As those scripts uses the Novice Castle guild, comments those lines (already commented by default)
on the scripts_athena.conf file:

//npc: npc/events/nguild/nguild_dunsw.txt
//npc: npc/events/nguild/nguild_treas.txt
//npc: npc/events/nguild/nguild_guardians.txt
